              <h2>Targeted</h2>
              <p>Where most care jobs sites really on attracting as many potential carers as possible, we focus on Twitter, Facebook and Google advertising, as well as targeted use of social media, to ensure adverts are shown to the right potential carers, in the right location, at the right time.</p>
              <p>We have also made sure our entire website is optimised for mobile and tablets. Each advert changes its structure and look subtly to ensure it is as attractive and readable, no matter how people access it.</p>

              <h2>Realistic Pricing</h2>
              <p>£24 for a job advert is too much and £175 (we're looking at you Reed...) is daylight robbery. Five years ago, running a jobs site would have been expensive but that just isn't the case anymore. Technical improvements means running such jobs site cost 5% or 10% of what they used to - so <strong>all we ask is for a helpful contribution of 99p per advert posted</strong>.</p>
